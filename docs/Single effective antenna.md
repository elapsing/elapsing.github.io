# Single Effective Antenna

*Reference: Beamforming Design in Short-Packet Transmission for URLLC in Cell-Free Massive MIMO System*

This means that each UE is equipped with one antenna or several antennas are combined to a single effective antenna using antenna selection or receive combining [E. Björnson and E. Jorswieck, “Optimal resource allocation in coordinated multi-cell systems,” in Now Foundations and Trends in Communications and Information Theory, vol. 9, no. 2, 2013.].
