# Notations

Boldface lowercase letters, boldface uppercase letters, and lowercase letters denote vectors, matrices, and scalers, respectively. 

Matrices and vectors are denoted by boldface upper-case and lower-case letters, respectively. 

Calligraphy letters $\mathcal{M}$ are used to denote sets. And $|\mathcal{M}|$ represents the cardinality of the set $\mathcal{M}$.

 $(\cdot)^T,(\cdot)^H$ denotes the transpose and the conjugate transpose.

The superscripts $(\cdot)^T,(\cdot)^H$ and $(\cdot)^{\dagger}$ denote the matrix transpose, conjugate transpose and pseudo-inverse operations, respectively.

 $\ell_p$-norm of a vector and the expectation are denoted as $\|\cdot\|_p$.

$||\cdot||$ denotes the Euclidean 2-norm of a vector.

$\|\cdot\|$ represents the $l_2$-norm of a vector.

$\mathbb{E}\{\cdot\}$. Tr$\{\cdot\}$ represents the trace operation.

 $\mathbb{E}\{\cdot\}$ denotes statistical expectation.

 $\otimes$ denotes the Kronecker product.

$\mathbf{A}^H$ and $\operatorname{det}[\mathbf{A}]$ denote the conjugate transpose and determinant of matrix $\mathbf{A}$, respectively. 

 $\mathbf{I}_M$ denotes the $M \times M$ identity matrix.

 $\mathcal{C} \mathcal{N}\left(0, \sigma^2\right)$ denotes the distribution of a circular symmetric complex Gaussian random variable with zero mean and variance $\sigma^2$.
