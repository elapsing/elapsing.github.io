## Research Experiences

<p style="text-align:left;"><b>Resource Allocation Design for NOMA in Short Packet Communications</b><span style="float:right;">Jun. 2022 – Now</span></p>	
Southeast University | Advised by Prof. Jiaheng Wang
- Analyzed the impacts of finite blocklength and explored resource allocation methods for NOMA systems in short packet communications to balance transmission data rates and error performance
- Proposed a joint optimization scheme for the powers and transmission rates of multiple users and further developed a simplified algorithm, which both perform better than other baselines (validated by MATLAB)
- Extended the proposed resource management scheme to scenarios with more users and more complicated (massive-)MIMO settings

<p style="text-align:left;"><b>Resource Allocation Design for NOMA in Short Packet Communications</b><span style="float:right;">Nov. 2021 – Apr. 2022</span></p>
Southeast University | Advised by Prof. Jiaheng Wang
- Designed a resource scheduling and user grouping scheme in uplink NOMA for the power control and phase adjustment method considering the modulation order of transmission
- Achieved the performance goal: increasing the number of connections by 20% when ensuring throughput QoS requirements of the eMBB uplink users (validated by MATLAB)

<p style="text-align:left;"><b>Federated Learning-Based Heterogeneous Network Interference Coordination</b><span style="float:right;">Oct. 2020 – Aug. 2021</span></p>	
Southeast University | Advised by Prof. Jiaheng Wang
- Established an interference coordination model for a downlink millimeter-wave heterogeneous network, which needs a jointly optimization of base station selection, beam width, and transmit power
- Constructed a federated learning network model to implement distributed learning for joint optimization problem. Achieved the expected interference coordination goal with its performance approaching that of the traditional optimization scheme (validated by Python-based TensorFlow)

<p style="text-align:left;"><b>Covert Channel Design for LCD Display Terminals</b><span style="float:right;">Nov. 2018 – Nov. 2019</span></p>	
Southeast University | Advised by Prof. Yubo Song
- Devised a special kind of lattice-like symbol with relative grayscale properties for covert transmission to reduce the impacts of the original background on grayscale detection, thus improving decoding robustness
- Redesigned the existing image processing method to solve the data grid offset caused by the capturing and correction of the display area and reduce the distortion incurred by unstable screen-shooting channels
- Structured the system prototype and integrated required functions with C++, rated 'good' as the key innovation project of Southeast University

## Contests
<p style="text-align:left;"><b>'Huawei Cup' National Post-graduate Mathematical Contest in Modeling</b><span style="float:right;">Apr. 2022</span></p>   
Second Place (Top 1‱), National First Prize
**Contest topic: Low-complexity calculation and storage modeling of massive correlated matrices**
- Derived a novel scheme of matrix partitioning based on substituted adjacent right singular matrices in SVD to avoid high-order matrix inversion and further designed a successive over relaxation (SOR)-based algorithm
- Formed a perfect complexity evaluation system by supplementing the unit complexity of complex number operations and matrix operations, achieving standardization and precision
- Extended our scheme to massive MIMO systems where transmission precoding and MMSE equalizer based on SVD are implemented to process noisy signals on correlated channels over a continuous time period

<p style="text-align:left;"><b>'TI Cup' National Undergraduate Electronics Design Contest</b><span style="float:right;">Oct. 2020</span></p>
